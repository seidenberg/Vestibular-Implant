Description:
    The vestibular system plays a critical role in our sensory system helping us stabilize our visual understanding and
    maintaining balance such as our head and body postures. As a result, this system is necessary to orient ourselves in
    space. The following program aims to simulate a vestibular implant according to the steps described in the task
    analysis and delivers the output as instructed.
